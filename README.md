## Game Modes
There are two different game modes for Bubble Shooter: Classic and Expert. 
- **Classic:** Just a regular ole bubble shooter game. The objective is to clear all of the bubbles off of the screen with as many points as possible. There is no time limit, but it tests your patience! 
- **Expert:** The objective of this mode is to clear all of the bubbles before they reach the bad area. Sounds easy, but did we mention that the bubbles drop down rows? Good luck trying to pass this level! 

### Scoring System
- Here is the point system of the colored bubbles: 
  - Dark Blue: 1 pts
  - Green: 2 pts
  - Purple: 3 pts
  - Red: 4 pts
  - Yellow: 5 pts
  - Light Blue: 6 pts

In order to score points, you need to score sets of 3 or more bubbles. The score of that set is (Set Size x Pts of Colored Bubble). Hanging, or isolated, bubbles will not be scored when popped. 

**NOTE: High scores will reset once you go back to the Main Menu screen.** High scores will stay the same for both game modes. 


## How to Open Project in Unity
0. Download Unity Hub and either `Bubble Shooter - Mac.zip` or `Bubble Shooter - PC.zip`.
1. Make sure you have `Unity 2018.4.20f1` installed.
2. Unzip the project folder and open it with Unity Hub. Make sure you check the Target Platform that you are opening it with. 
3. Open the project folder.

**NOTE:** If you want to view the scripts without downloading Unity, you need to download either `Bubble Shooter - Mac .zip` or `Bubble Shooter - PC.zip` from the repo. After unzipping, go to the `Assets/Scripts` folder and view the the C# scripts. 


## Known Bugs
- When opening the project in the Unity, the pre-fabs may need to be reloaded to ensure their function scripts are properly attached to them. This should not impact the function of the game executable.
