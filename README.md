## Game Modes
There are two different game modes for Bubble Shooter: Classic and Expert. 
- **Classic:** Just a regular ole bubble shooter game. The objective is to clear all of the bubbles off of the screen with as many points as possible. There is no time limit, but it tests your patience! 
- **Expert:** The objective of this mode is to clear all of the bubbles before they reach the bad area. Sounds easy, but did we mention that the bubbles drop down rows? Good luck trying to pass this level! 

### Scoring System
- Here is the point system of the colored bubbles: 
  - Dark Blue: 1 pts
  - Green: 2 pts
  - Purple: 3 pts
  - Red: 4 pts
  - Yellow: 5 pts
  - Light Blue: 6 pts

In order to score points, you need to score sets of 3 or more bubbles. The score of that set is (Set Size x Pts of Colored Bubble). Hanging, or isolated, bubbles will not be scored when popped.
